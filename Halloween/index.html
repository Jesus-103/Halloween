            <p>Halloween or Hallowe'en (less known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve or All Saints' Eve) is a holiday celebrated on October 31, the eve of the Western Christian festival of All Saints. The commemoration of Allhallowtide begins,8 the time of the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints, martyrs and all the faithful departed.

        <div class="titulo">Because pumpkins</div>
            <p>As Christianity supplanted pagan rites, the festival became All  Hallows Eve, which is contracted to Halloween, which is celebrated before All Saints' Day.<br>

            A tradition that emerged in Ireland was to turn carved turnips into lamps, in allusion to the legend of Jack o' Lantern.<br>

            The story is that a certain Jack made a pact with the devil that went wrong and he was condemned to haunt the eternal night, lighting his path with a piece of incandescent coal inside a turnip carved with holes.<br>

            Locals began carrying these "Jack o' Lanterns" around villages and leaving them lit in front of houses on Halloween night.<br>

            They were supposed to represent supernatural beings or serve to scare away evil spirits.<br>

            The Irish immigrants who arrived in waves to the United States in the 19th century found in their new country the fruit of a plant that was easier to carve: the pumpkin.<br>

            This round, orange food is harvested in the US in the fall and that is why it is so closely associated with Halloween in that country.<br>

    <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="col-2">
        <p>One theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots.<!-- Some go further and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church. Other academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day. Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century, and then through American influence various Halloween customs spread to other countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.-->

<section id="Why is it October 31?">
    <div class="titulo">Why is it October 31?</div>
        <p>The origins date back to Ireland more than 3,000 years ago, since coinciding with the autumn solstice, farmers celebrated the end of the season under the belief that during that night of October 31 the spirits walked among the living.

<section id="Why dress up?">
    <div class="titulo">Why dress up?</div>
        </p>This tradition has its origins in Samhain, a pagan celebration held by the Celts for centuries. According to their customs, people dressed up to avoid being terrified by the spirits that descended to earth during that night.
